;; The sdfs package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(let ((package-dir (concat "/usr/share/"
                           (symbol-name flavor)
                           "/site-lisp/sdfs")))
;; If package-dir does not exist, the sdfs package must have
;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
  (when (file-directory-p package-dir)
    (setq load-path (cons package-dir load-path))
    (autoload 'sdfs-mode "sdfs-mode"
      "Major mode for editing sdfs files." t)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.sdfs$" . sdfs-mode))))
